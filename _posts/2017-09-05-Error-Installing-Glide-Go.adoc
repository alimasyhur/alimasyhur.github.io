:hp-alt-title: Error Installing Glide Go

Go has package manager like Java with Maven, PHP with composer, Python with pip, etc. See this documentation for details 
https://glide.readthedocs.io/en/latest[Glide Documentation].
After Installing Glide with this command

`curl https://glide.sh/get | sh` you will face this kind of error:
`_glide not found. Did you add $LGOBIN to your $PATH?_`.

Don't be panic, do this command!
Add this code below on the bottom of your .bashrc file.

`export GOPATH=$HOME/(Path of your go project)
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin</code>`

For Example:
`export GOPATH=$HOME/projects`
`export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin`

And then run installation command again.
`curl https://glide.sh/get | sh`

And your installation will be successfully done.
glide version v0.12.3 installed successfully
